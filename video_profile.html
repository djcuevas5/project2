                I'm into chill music a lot. This song just hits different with what I'd personally experienced in my past, making it the top of my list. The main meaning behind this song expresses the eternal feeling and inability to forget someone who was once an important part of one's life. It conveys fear of forgetting, the struggle to keep a fading memory alive, and the desperation to ask if the other person still remembers.

            <p>
                I love this pop band since 2018, and this is the first song that made me love the band. This is a powerful and emotional ballad that delves deep into the aftermath of a heart-wrenching breakup. The lyrics are vulnerable and introspective, conveying the raw feelings linked with lost love and the need for closure.
