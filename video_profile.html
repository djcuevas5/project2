				<p>
				I'm into chill music a lot. This song just hits different with what I'd personally experience in my past, making the top of my list. The main meaning
				behind this expresses the eternal feeling and inability to froget someone who was once an important part of one's life; 
				conveys fear of forgetting, the stuggle to keep a fading memory alive, and the desperation to ask if the other person still
				remembers.

				<p>
				I love this pop band since 2018 and this is the first song that made me love the band. This is a powerful and emotional ballad
				that delves deep into the aftermath of a heart-wrenching breakup. The lyrics are vulnerable and introspective, 
				conveying the raw feelings linked with lost love and the need for closure.

				<p>
				I loved SZA during my high school years. Once she released SOS, this is song that is played on repeat.
				"Nobody Gets Me" by SZA explores a past relationship filled with disappointment and heartbreak, highlighting the emotions of frustration, betrayal, and the desire to hold onto the familiarity of the past.
				Despite acknowledging the relationship's flaws, the song conveys a complex desire to hold onto the past.

			   <p>
			   This is my favorite Tagalog song at the moment. It translate to "Until When"
			   The lyrics describe a person hopelessly in love, e
			   xpressing the vulnerability and desperation that are sometimes connected with unrequited love, 
			   as well as the agony and desire that many people can relate to..

				<p>
				When I was growing up this the song that was always play on the radio.
				"Tonight" is a poignant song that explores the emotions of love, loss, and longing after a loved one.
				It serves as a reminder of hope and consolation, addressing the human need for connection, both physical and spiritual, during challenging times.
